    "You're familiar with adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing numbers in R. To do this you use the +, -, *, and / symbols. These symbols are called binary operators because they take two inputs, an input from the left and an input from the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "In R you can define your own binary operators. In the next script we'll show you how.\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax for creating new binary operators in R is unlike anything else in R, but it allows you to define a new syntax for your function. I would only recommend making your own binary operator if you plan on using it often!\n",
    "\n",
    "User-defined binary operators have the following syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "    %[whatever]% \n",
    "\n",
    "where [whatever] represents any valid variable name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say I wanted to define a binary operator that multiplied two numbers and then added one to the product. An implementation of that operator is below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```R\n",
    "\"%mult_add_one%\" <- function(left, right){ Notice the quotation marks!\n",
    "    left * right + 1\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "I could then use this binary operator like `4 %mult_add_one% 5` which would evaluate to 21.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your own binary operator below from absolute scratch! Your binary operator must be called %p% so that the expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"Good\" %p% \"job!\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "will evaluate to: \"Good job!\""
